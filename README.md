# About this repo

This is the codebase for our V3 robot, the robot that went to and won worlds for the 2022-2023 Power Play season of First Tech Challenge.

## Credits

This project was built off of and heavily modified from the [Roadrunner Quickstart](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart).

It also uses the [FTC Dashboard](https://github.com/acmerobotics/ftc-dashboard) for testing purposes.

## File structure

Every piece of code is under the "TeamCode/src/main/.../teamcode" directory.

Roadrunner related code has been refactored under it's own folder "/roadrunner", though many new classes were added to handle new custom developed features.

Everything else should be self-explanatory.
